  <p class="p-4">
    I am a full stack developer enrolled on the Full Stack Track course at iO Academy. I bring a
    unique, creative edge to my work having a background both academically and professionally in
    design. My experience as a designer has given me a diverse set of transferable skills that I am
    eager to apply to my career as a developer. I’m passionate about electronic music and have a
    monthly radio show. On the weekends, you can probably find me exploring the countryside with my
    camera. I’m open, collaborative and have a fondness to make a positive impact on the world
    through the work that I do. I am excited to explore different ways of achieving this, as well as
    to meeting other like-minded people in the process.
