      "I volunteered to rebuild the 20th Century Flicks website, a project that allowed me to enhance my skills in NextJS, TypeScript, and Tailwind. As a devoted film fanatic, reimagining the old site, which had been in use for 15 years, was the perfect opportunity for me. I incorporated Meilisearch, a Rust-based autocomplete search tool, enabling users to explore a vast collection of over 20,000 movies available for rental, both in-person and by post. The design takes inspiration from Bladerunner, which is my favourite flick.",
